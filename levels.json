        "intro_text": "You take a deep breath, relieved you’ve managed a minor miracle: making it from bed to this spot with a warm cup of coffee without waking a soul. You feel slightly ridiculous, sitting on a too-small plastic chair in full snow gear, surrounded by pitch darkness. Each sip of coffee is a battle—your gloves are too big for the mug handle, you have to pull your ski mask up and down between sips, and your nose won’t stop running. It’s your last night with shelter and warmth for weeks, yet the barracks feel suffocating. Not because of a lack of oxygen, but because of the coldness you’ve received from your platoon.\n\nYou never expected their respect to come easily, but you also didn’t anticipate open disdain. The humiliation still stings. Pinned against a wall by one of the enlisted men, with the rest of the platoon standing by, watching. He called you a coward, lumping you in with every other platoon leader, even though he barely knew you. And worse, no one stepped in—not to stop him, not to defend you. Their silence implied agreement, their gazes full of quiet judgment. You replay the moment over and over, imagining how you could have responded differently, how you could have salvaged your reputation.\n\nBut as your thoughts churn, the setting offers a strange sense of peace. The crashing waves and rustling trees, the fresh, salty air—so different from the endless hum and staleness of the city. Out here, danger surrounds you in every direction, but you’re safe where you are. Oddly, there’s something cozy about that.\n\nThen you see it—a faint red blink far inland. Your breath catches, and your mind races. You try to think of every possible explanation for the light, but only one makes sense.\n\nThe Eye.\n\nYou sit up straight and your eyes widen. You’ve heard countless experts describe Russia’s infamous drone system, but you’ve never heard of anyone actually seeing it. Privately, you’ve entertained the possibility that The Eye was just propaganda—an exaggeration spun by Russia to sow fear. The evidence always seemed like hearsay, a story passed along through too many hands. But now, you’ve seen it yourself. Just a single blink in the darkness, but that’s all it took.\n\nYour throat tightens as the implications settle in. The stories were true. These drones have become truly invisible through intelligence. After a decade of trench warfare in Eastern Europe, The Eye has perfected its algorithms, becoming a predator that stalks in the shadows, hunting humans like prey. There’s no longer a human hand at the final moment of warfare—no one pulling the trigger who might hesitate and spare your life. Now, nothing stands between the cold calculus of sociopathic politicians and the victims on the other end of the trigger. On your way here, you’d hoped this was all a false alarm. But now, it’s clear that your fate may already be out of your hands. This might be your last night of peace before stepping into its territory.\n\nIn just one day, your eager optimism has crumbled into dread. But dread is no stranger to you and you’re not going to let it stop you now. There’s nothing to return home to anyways.\n\nThe dawn is still hours away, but you start planning one last simulation drill for today. Tomorrow, you step into the unknown.",

Whatever was left of the military’s structure and funding, it wasn’t here.\n\nThey’d pieced together what they could: scattered sightings, stories from locals, intercepted chatter, and patterns in drone activity. It all pointed to the same conclusion—this wasn’t just a opportunistic commercial mining operation. And the drones seemed to be zeroing in on our locations.\nYour next mission was simple on paper: head six clicks north along the river and recon a staging site. The officers believed it was the center of whatever the Russians were planning. What that was, no one could say. Supplies? Something worse? The only certainty was that the drones would be patrolling, silent and precise, ready to strike at the first mistake.\n\nAs you stepped back into the frost, the cold’s bite reminded you just how far north you’d come, how alien this place felt compared to the world you thought you knew. The jagged peaks outlined in moonlight towered over faint traces of steep, rocky surfaces, each slope a stark reminder of the overwhelming scale of this land.

The miles you’ve traveled, the effort it’s taken, and the realization that you’ve barely scratched the surface of this untamed wilderness gnawed at you. It’s a land that feels untouched, unclaimed, and indifferent to human life.\n\nWhatever brought the Russians here had to be as ruthless and unyielding as the landscape itself.\n\nSomewhere ahead, the truth waited.

Instead, it looked almost ordinary: industrial equipment, storage crates, and work lights cutting through the frostbitten night. Still, there was too much hurry for it to feel innocent. The workers were quieter than any worksite I've ever seen with a seriousness that portrayed military. Working this late into the night was incredibly unusual, although this will likely be dismissed by your superiors as due to the disorienting daylight time this far north. When they did speak they spoke quietly enough - as if they were expecting to be eavesdropped on. Everything about it felt off, but you had no proof. \nYou were going to need to take an alternate route on the way back. The drone coverage was more intense than anyone at the command bunker was expecting. Your return route would be through dangerous mountainous terrain, but at least there would be fewer drones this time. \nYou were physically exhausted and low on water. The upcoming trip was filled with anguish but the fear of staying motivated you to move.",
