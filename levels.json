Invisible until they are not. And by the time you see them, it is often too late. They do not aim to kill outright. They target your legs, leaving you to scream and cry for help. Bait for the next poor soul who dares to cross. It is precision warfare, faster and more ruthless than anything a human could manage. This is not the war you read about in history books. Strength does not matter. Bravery does not matter. Only survival does.\\nYour orders are simple: move up the river along the hillside and reach the command bunker. Resupply. Regroup. Command has jammed the enemy drones temporarily, forcing them to reveal their positions through their anti-jamming mechanism. But the jamming will not last forever, and when it ends, the drones will go invisible again. Time is not on your side.\\nYour heart pounds as your commanding officer nods. The weight of everything—duty, fear, inevitability—presses on your chest. This is war now: a game of pattern recognition. If you can read the gaps in their coverage, you will make it to the bunker. \\nYou force your legs to move. The cold air burns your face. There is no turning back.",

Instead, it looked almost ordinary: industrial equipment, storage crates, and work lights cutting through the frostbitten night. Still, there was too much hurry for it to feel innocent. The workers were quieter than any worksite I've ever seen with a seriousness that portrayed military. Working this late into the night was incredibly unusual, although this will likely be dismissed by your superiors as due to the disorienting daylight time this far north. When they did speak they spoke quietly enough - as if they were expecting to be eavesdropped on. Everything about it felt off, but you had no proof. \nYou were going to need to take an alternate route on the way back. The drone coverage was more intense than anyone at the command bunker was expecting. Your return route would be through dangerous mountainous terrain, but at least there would be fewer drones this time. \nYou were physically exhausted and low on water.
